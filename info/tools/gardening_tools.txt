3. Garden Spade:
   - A garden spade is designed for digging larger holes, edging, and slicing through roots. Look for a spade with a sharp, sturdy blade and a comfortable handle for efficient use.

4. Garden Rake:
   - A garden rake helps level and smooth soil, remove debris, and prepare seedbeds. Choose a rake with sturdy tines and an ergonomic handle for comfortable use.

5. Hoe:

6. Garden Shears:
   - Garden shears are useful for pruning and shaping plants, trimming branches, and harvesting herbs and vegetables. Look for sharp, high-quality shears with comfortable handles.

7. Pruning Saw:
   - A pruning saw is necessary for cutting through thicker branches and limbs. It's helpful for tree pruning and managing overgrown shrubs. Choose a saw with a sharp blade and ergonomic handle.

8. Garden Clippers:
   - Garden clippers, also known as secateurs or pruners, are ideal for precise pruning and deadheading. Select a pair with a bypass cutting action for clean cuts and consider models with adjustable tension.

9. Garden Gloves:
   - Protect your hands from thorns, rough surfaces, and potentially harmful substances with a good pair of gardening gloves. Choose gloves that offer a balance of protection, dexterity, and breathability.

10. Watering Can:

11. Garden Hose and Nozzle:

12. Garden Sprayer:

 planted directly into the ground.
