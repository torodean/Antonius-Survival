Section: Storage and Lifespans of Fuel Sources for Off-Grid Living

Proper storage and understanding the lifespans of fuel sources are essential for maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of these fuels in off-grid living situations. Gasoline, propane, kerosene, and butane each have specific storage requirements and lifespans that should be considered to ensure their safety and optimal performance. Here's an overview of the storage considerations and lifespans of these fuel sources:

1. Gasoline:
   - Storage: Gasoline should be stored in approved containers specifically designed for fuel storage. Use containers made of non-reactive materials such as metal or approved plastic, ensuring they are tightly sealed to prevent leakage and evaporation.
